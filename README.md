# Implementing the model
This repository includes the files necessary to reproduce the steps that were followed for the implementation of the LSTM model, from teleoperating the robot through the training scenarios and recording its LiDAR readings, position inside the Motion Capture system, target point and linear and angular velocities, to training, validating and testing the LSTM model.
