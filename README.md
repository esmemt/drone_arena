# Implementing the model
This repository includes the files necessary to reproduce the steps that were followed for the implementation of the LSTM model, from teleoperating the robot through the training scenarios and recording its LiDAR readings, position inside the Motion Capture system, target point and linear and angular velocities, to training, validating and testing the LSTM model.

## Relevant files
You can find videos of the model being tested, the presentation for the project, and relevant .csv files in [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DtHG-nLFXtRnXHjDUmPfr6xOAHteYCBR?usp=drive_link) Drive folder. In there, you'll find a file named "Dataset for training the model.
csv", containing the data obtained from the 100 user-operated examples, which was used for training the LSTM neural network. The resulting model is in the file "trainingDA.h5"
